This is a Rails project to attempt to do something useful with GTFS data.  The questions you should be able to answer are:
1.  What stations are nearby?
2.  What are the times for the next trains leaving from (station)?
3.  How do I get from (point A) to (point B)?

Routing is done with a messy A* algorithm.  I suspect most of the problem is due to my data structures imposing higher big-O on my access to frequently 
needed data.

It's based on Andy Atkinson's gtfs-helper project, but I rewrote it sufficiently that I decided not to fork, but just start over.  He's at
